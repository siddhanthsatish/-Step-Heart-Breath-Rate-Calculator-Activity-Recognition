# Step-Heart-Breath-Rate-Calculator + Activity-Recognition

▪ Detected the number of steps taken from iPhone's accelerometer data using a step-detection algorithm with 99% accuracy.__
▪ Developed an activity recognition classifier to identify whether the user is cycling, walking, jumping, or sitting with 85% accuracy.__
▪ Derived heart rate and breath rate from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal using signal filtering techniques.__
▪ Technologies Used: Python Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks.
